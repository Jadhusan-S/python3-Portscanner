# Python3-Portscanner

This script is a simple Python port scanner that allows you to scan a specified host for open or closed ports within a specified range. It utilizes socket programming and multi-threading to efficiently scan multiple ports simultaneously.
<br>

To use the script, you need to provide the host you want to scan and specify the starting and ending ports to scan. The script will then display the status of each port, indicating whether it is open or closed.
